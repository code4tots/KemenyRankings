KemenyRankings
==============

Simple C code I wrote to calculate kemeny rankings IIRC it handles ~10 candidates under a second

I think I wrote it at some point last year (2012-2013), when prof DeLoera talked about Kemeny Rankings and how difficult it was to calculate them for large values, and said something like how he couldn't just easily download a program that could quickly calculate kemeny rankings for 10 candidates off the internet.

Or at least I think that was what he said... it was a while ago.

At any rate, I remember thinking it was silly because 10! is appx 3.6 mil, so at least for 10 candidates, brute force should be blazingly fast. So I think I took about an hour in the school computer lab to write it up.

I would have thrown this script away, except some other students were doing research related to kemeny rankings and was interested in using my code. So yea, that was kinda neat.
